# Xeyes for Windows

## Overview

In the old days, UNIX workstations had large and monochrome screen.
So, It was easy to lose sight of the mouse cursor. 
One solution was xeyes. The xeyes application is able to follow 
the mouse cursor.
Xeyes for Windows is an xeyes application that runs on Windows.

This software is based on WinEyes 1.2.
